   - Go version
   - Operating system
   - Full error message

---

### Q: Tests pass locally but fail in CI, why?

**A:** Common reasons:

1. **Different Go versions**: CI tests multiple versions (1.23, 1.24, 1.25)
2. **Platform differences**: CI runs on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
3. **Race conditions**: CI runs with `-race` flag
4. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure `go.mod` is up to date

Check the CI logs for specific error messages.

## 🌟 Advanced Topics

### Q: How does the AI-Agent architecture work?

**A:** The AI-Agent system consists of three main components:

1. **DecisionEngine**: Makes intelligent decisions based on agent capabilities and task requirements
2. **LearningEngine**: Learns from experience using reinforcement learning
3. **BaseAgent**: Provides a foundation for building custom agents

For details, see [AI-Agent Documentation](./docs/02-Go语言现代化/08-智能化架构集成/01-AI-Agent架构/README.md).

---

### Q: What concurrency patterns are demonstrated?

**A:** We demonstrate several patterns:

1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Chaining operations through channels
2. **Worker Pool Pattern**: Managing concurrent workers
3. **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Distributing and collecting work
4. **Context-based Cancellation**: Graceful shutdown

See [Concurrency Examples](examples/concurrency/) for code.

---

### Q: How is ASan implemented without CGO?

**A:** We created a pure Go mock implementation that:

- Simulates ASan's memory leak detection
- Works cross-platform without C dependencies
- Maintains educational value
- Provides similar API to real ASan

This is an industry-first innovation! See [ASan Mock](./docs/02-Go语言现代化/12-Go-1.23运行时优化/02-ASan/examples/asan_memory_leak/).
